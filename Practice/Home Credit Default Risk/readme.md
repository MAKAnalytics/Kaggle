# Home Credit Default Risk
In this notebook, we will look at the [Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk "Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk")  machine learning competition.

The objective is to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. This is a standard supervised classification task:

* Supervised: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features
* Classification: The label is a binary variable, 0 (will repay loan on time), 1 (will have difficulty repaying loan)
